# PLAYING FIND THE BOTTLENECK, STAGE: DATA GATHERING [NG]

Author: Brendan Higgins
Framework Category: Operate and Maintain
Specialty Area: Customer Service and Technical Support
Work Role: Technical Support Specialist
Task Description: Monitor and report client-level computer system performance. (T0502)
Scenario
During a systems design meeting our systems engineer noted that the hard drive in our AD server may be a performance bottleneck. Before our next meeting we will need more information so that we might select the right system components to upgrade to best increase performance. To rule in or our the AD server's hard drive we need you to run some performance tests on it and return the resulting data to us. Be sure to check with the operations staff and see what benchmarks they prefer.

Additional Information
More details and objectives about this challenge will be introduced during the challenge meeting, which will start once you begin deploying the challenge.

You will be able to check your progress during this challenge using the check panel within the workspace once the challenge is deployed. The checks within the check panel report on the state of some or all of the required tasks within the challenge.

Once you have completed the requested tasks, you will need to document the methodology you used with as much detail and professionalism as necessary. This should be done on the documentation tab within the workspace once the challenge is deployed. Below the main documentation section be sure to include a tagged list of applications you used to complete the challenge.

Your username/password to access all virtual machines and services within the workspace will be the following...
Username: playerone
Password: password123

The username/password used to access the Firewall's web interface within the workspace will be the following...
Username: admin
Password: password123

You are provided with Windows "Perfmon" and "CrystalDiskMark" to benchmark the Domain Controller.

The report from Perfmon must be named "Disk_report1.csv" and must be placed in "C:\PerfLogs\Admin\". The report from Crystal Disk Mark must be named "Disk_Report2.txt" and must be placed in "C:\PerfLogs\Admin\".

# MEETING BRIEF
Gilly Bates" I was out in the field yesterday and remoted onto the AD to check something and it was absolutely crawling. I have no idea if it was just a bad connection from where I was, or if the server is having some hardware issues. Can someone please check the AD server for me today? I'm not available but it needs to be checked on!

Thanh Akasaka: I went by the AD while going to grab some coffee, Gill. One of the drives in that area is running really loud. I have no idea what box or drive is the culprit because I'm not really familiar with the hardware itself... and I didn't really want to check because I really needed coffee... You understand I'm sure.

Gilly Bates: @playerone, can you do me a favor and jump on the AD box and just run a couple of tests to see if the HDD on the AD is about to explode or something?

Richard LeGrand: SOMEONE CHECK ON THE ACTIVE DNS SERVER PLEASE. THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE YESTERDAY IT SOUNDS SERIOUS

Gilly Bates: Yeah, well... @playerone just run a perfmon with the disk counters enabled and export a csv report from that to the usual "C:\PerfLogs\Admin\" directory and call it "Disk_Report1.csv", also I think I've got some HDD benchmarking software on that box called Crystal Mark or something, run that too an export a report from that to the same location but call it "Disk_Report2.txt"

# DOCUMENTATION
Create Performance Monitor Report:

Opened the Domain-Controller Virtual Machine, signed in with playerone username and password, right clicked on Start, clicked Search, searched for Performance Monitor, in left panel expanded Data Collector Sets, right clicked User Defined -> New -> Data Collector Set, named Disk_Reprt1, Create manually (Advanced), Create Data Logs -> Checked Performance Counter, Event Trace Data, System configuration information, Added Logical Disk and PHysical Disk Counters and Saved to Root Directory: C:\PerfLogs\Admin\, Run program as Playerone and inserted username and password. After Disk_Report1 Data Collector Set was i right click on DataCollector01 -> Properties -> Log format -> Comma Seperated -> Pressed Apply and then OK.  Then Right clicked Disk_Report1 under User Defined in left panel and clicked Start, waited a few minutes and Stopped it. Wen to C:\PerfLogs\Admin\Disk_Report1\AD_20230827-000001 and Renamed DataCollector03 as Disk_Report1.csv and moved file into C:\PerfLogs\Admin\. Received Green Check: Desired State. 

Create Crystal Disk Mark Report:

Right clicked on Start, clicked Search, searched for Crystal Disk Mark, Clicked Green All button, waited till program completed, File -> Save (text) as Disk_Report2.txt in C:\PerfLogs\Admin\. Received Green Check: Desired State.
